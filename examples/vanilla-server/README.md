# Vanilla Server

This example uses the vanilla server provided from the official
website (https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server).

We changed the IP, world seed, the MOTD and the spawn protection in the `server.properties` file.

## Install it

```bash
crafty install
```

## Run it

```bash
crafty run
```
