The bug report issue has a template already set up, so you can fill in the required information.

## Feature requests

If you have a cool feature in mind or something you want to see Crafty implement,
you can share it in the [Ideas](https://github.com/zeke-io/crafty/discussions/categories/ideas) category in
our [Discussions](https://github.com/zeke-io/crafty/discussions/) section.

It will be discussed, we will ask questions to know exactly how to implement the feature properly,
and you can receive feedback from other users and contributors.
